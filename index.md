# Introduction

This site provide documentation for the ispapicli tool. Here you will find documentation for installing on several operation systems, namely Windows, macOS / OS X, and Debian derivates like Ubuntu.

What is this tool about?

This tool enables you to connect to our backend system API and to manage your account through GUI or Command Line Interface.

In general, this tool consists of two major parts: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Shell (or so-called command line interpreter).

First, you may start by runnig the following command there:

This will show you how to use the tool:

From this point on, you can follow the notes and run your desired command.
However, here are few important notes for you:

* Note that you can either use the equal sign "=" e.g. "- -command = querydomainlist", or
* You can use spaces as a separator e.g. "- -command querydomainlist"
* You may also use shortcuts, e.g. "-c" instead of "- -command", refer to the tool help command for more information about other commands
* You must login first in order to requrest a command, you can login by running the command:

```bash
    -u = <your user id> -p = <your password> -e = {ote,live}
```

## Run it via GUI

There two ways to start the GUI:

* From the Shell, then run the command:

```bash
    ispapi -g OR ispapi --gui
```

* From the executable/portable file by simply openning it, it will immediately start the GUI

* Tip: **You can run exactly the same commands from the GUI and Shell**
